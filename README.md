sFFLHD
======

This R package provides a class that generates experiment sFFLHD designs. Sequential full factorial-based Latin hypercube design were created by Duan, Ankenman, Sanchez, and Sanchez (2015, Technometrics).

To create a new design you use the function `sFFLHD$new` and must give in the number of dimensions, `D`, and the batch size/number of levels per factor, `L`. An example is shown below (the last line can be repeated when run in console to see how new batches are added).

``` r
library(sFFLHD)
s <- sFFLHD$new(D=2,L=3)
plot(s$get.batch(),xlim=0:1,ylim=0:1,pch=19)
#> Warning in DoE.base::oa.design(nruns = L^2, nfactors = D + 1, nlevels =
#> L, : resources were not sufficient for optimizing column selection
abline(h=(0:(s$Lb))/s$Lb,v=(0:(s$Lb))/s$Lb,col=3);points(s$get.batch(),pch=19)
```

By default the new points are selected using maximin distance optimization to spread them out. This is why points will end up near corners. This option will slow down the code a little but generally not noticeably compared to what the design is used for. If set to `FALSE` then the points are randomly placed within their small grid box.
